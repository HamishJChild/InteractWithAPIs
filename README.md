# InteractWithAPIs
To produce a program which, when given the name of an artist, will produce the average (mean) number of words in their songs.


This will use an API that will need to use the name of an artist/artists given by a user (after checking this name with another API request) to find the mean number of words in their songs. I will need to investigate what API calls I can make in order to work out how to find the mean number of words in their songs.

First pass of functionality is complete and working.
Next steps:
- Create Artist class and move to OOP approach.
- Look at extending the CLI with adding multiple Artists.
- Turn main.py into a series of methods, and then a Main class with a __run__ method.
- Tests
